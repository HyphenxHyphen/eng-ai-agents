Assignment 1

Submitted 2/8 23:59 (README.md written 2/9 00:14)



Instructions on how to run the code:

assignments/assignment-1/01-assignment-part-1.ipynb contains an older version of the assignment.

Only after did I realize I accidentally saved assignment 1 to notebooks/assignments/assignment-1/01-assignment-part-1.ipynb.

I have elected to leave the correct file in notebooks/assignments/assignment-1/ for now as to preserve the edited time stamp.

I will contact the TA on 2/9 to see what I should do about this.



I currently do not have enough disk space to download Docker and WSL 2. I will speak with the TA to see what I should do about this.
